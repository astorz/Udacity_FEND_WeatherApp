# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project entails an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. It is the 3rd project in Udacity's **Front-End Web Developer** Nanodegree Program.

## Instructions
To run locally, the user should create a local web server using node.js. After navigating to the right directory in Terminal, run "node server.js". The app will run in the browser under localhost at port 8000. Local installation of node.js, express, as well as body-parser and cors (third-party middleware) is required before running the app.
